# c-gameimade
This is a basic console game I made for learning c++

# How to Run the Game
To run the game, you just download the exe file, that's it! I included all of the other c++ files just for the people who want to see the source code. It is very simple! I will add the exe file or maybe files in the releases page. Thanks!
